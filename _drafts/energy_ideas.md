The transition to sustainable energy is unequivocally one of civilization's acid tests.

The dominant narrative for sustainable energy is to curb climate change. The other much obvious one is that fossil fuels will run out within the century [^basecase], and, the world's economy depends on them as primary energy source (84% in 2020[^0]). 

What are the consituents on the rate of sustainable energy deployment? 
What is the structure of the US as system to deliver on this problem?

This post is an effort to understand these questions.

Dividing the system into 3 components: 

1. Inputs: Materials, Labor, Energy, Capital & Funding
2. Production: Manufacturing Capacity
3. Outputs: Market Dynamics

# **Inputs**
#### Materials 
- US had domestic supply chain of rare-earth metals. China flooded markets in late 90s (see Mountain Pass history).
- US has access to most raw materials but does low mining and no refinement (see reference).
- China has been on a 30-yr campaign to secure controlling stakes in mines and building inland processing capacity. Currenly > 60% of the world's mining and processing (see NREL)
- Processing technology is high-resource intensive with potential to be rethought (eg. Tesla's Battery day).

#### Labor
- Poor career prospects in mining has decreased academic research and workforce (see Society of Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration)

#### Energy

Electricity Industrial Prices 

| $ / MWh    |
| US | China | 
|------------|
| 76 [^3]|62 |

#### Capital & Funding Strategies
1. America leads in basic research and applied research, in part due to historical bipartisan support via grants 

# **Production** 
#### Manufacturing Capacity
2. China has clever ways to bypass WTO rules. Combination of grants, market discipline and structural incentives.
4. 50 years of offshoring has following operational consequences in the manufacturing stock: 
   - Eroded ability to implement and upscale innovations decreasing self-reliance.
   - US has an inadequate labor force -- in size and training.
7. There are strategic areas for self-reliance and national security: 
   - Chips, AI 

# **Outputs**
#### Market Dynamics

[^basecase]: The most simple base case for oil depletion is as follows:  
     - The US proved oil reserves are 1,244 million barrels [^1].
     - Suppose the current rate of ~20 million barrels[^2].
     - That's a 60 year runway. Natural gas and coal have similar scenarios with depletion ranges between 70-100 years.

**Raw Materials**
- Two groups of AM Materials:
  - **Rare Earth Elements**. Main end use is in permanent magnets and batteries.
  - **Battery Metals**. Mining is geographically concentrated and controlled by China. Refining mainly done in China.
- US exited Rare Earth Metals supply chain after China flooded markets in late 90s [^1]. Restarted operation with Mountain Pass in 2018 although 90% of output is refined in China and they have a minority stake in MP Materials.
- US has access to most raw materials but does low mining and no little to no refinement (see reference).
- China has been on a 30-yr campaign to secure controlling stakes in mines and building inland processing capacity. Currenly > 60% of the world's mining and processing (see NREL)

## US-China Bumping Heads
CCP has increased defense spending by 800% since the 90s. Although less than what they spend in their domestic spying apparatus, a tell sign of whay they find most worrisome.

In writing there is a thrill that, in the process, I may discover an anomaly or something new. But what appeals me most is how it extends memory, it allows me to relive the moment of when I wrote these words.
