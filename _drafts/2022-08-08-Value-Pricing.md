Pricing carries information that needs to be managed. 
Price management is a strong financial hedger.

Insight 1: Pricing carries information that needs to be managed. 
- Clear communication of why.
- Information about the value created by your product.
- About your brand and target audience.
- About which customers you value most as a company. 
- Brand may suffer when you only try to maximize real-time transactions.
- Needs a clearly defined leadership, responsbility, and accountability.

Insight 2: Pricing helps to stabilize operations.
- Pricing helps to smooth out demand seasonality which improves ability to plan operations.
- Businesses are built for the long-haul. Pricing helps you build the means (customer experience) to an end (profits).
- Stable, predictable businesses command higher valuation multiples.
- Example of Disney distributing demand through pricing to stabilize their operation and improve customer experience.

Insight 3: Pricing is an effective market research tool
- You don't know what people want unless you charge for it
- Pricing is a high signal feedback tool for businesses

Insight 4: Pricing is not about demand optimization 
- Algorithmic pricing 1.0 -> Supply/Demand Imbalances
- Algorithmic pricing 2.0 -> Network Value Optimization

Insight 5: Pricing is an innovation lever.
- Can you involve the user like IKEAs example of factoring Time & Distance into your pricing?
