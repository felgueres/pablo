Made a tool that extracts Kindle notes to use with LLMs.

- Gets highlights, notes, and metadata  
- Keyword search across books
- LLM explains highlighted sections

I want an effortless way to revisit reads, search, and find evidence in favor or against ideas. 
There's so much friction on Kindle that this space seems very unexplored.
