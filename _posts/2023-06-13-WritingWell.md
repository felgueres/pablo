Writing is a way to understand the noise and knowledge that surrounds me. 

I'm collecting ideas and new words to be better at it.

**re:non-fiction**

Present information with vigor, clarity and humanity.

Unity is the anchor of good writing. Variables of unity:
- Pronoun
- Tense
- Mood

For each, don't mix, focus on one.  

Useful questions

How much to cover?

Be definitive, reduce scope. 
Carve off your subject and be content to cover it well and stop.

What is the one point you want to make?
Your one goal it to leave the reader with a provocative thought that she hasn't thought before. 

This will dictate your unities: is this point better delivered in humour, or earnestness?

Persuasion is achieved by positional statements.
