An underestimated driver of progress is the sources of inspiration around us.  
One of my favorites came from watching cooking videos on youtube.

He is the classic underdog. An unassuming character who realizes the world is at odds with him but decides to better himself at whatever the cost. He also believes it must happen on his own terms, as success is not to become the person above on the ladder, but rather it is himself worth rising. 

Marco Pierre White strook me as a version of this character. He relentlessly pushed for 20 years to the top of cuisine to realize he was being judged by people with less skill and knowledge than him. He renounced the Michelin stars -- and all the concommitant benefits -- in favor of finding a new dream. This is the uncompromised character that [Emerson](https://archive.vcu.edu/english/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/emerson/essays/selfreliance.html) described. 

Whether a cook or a scientist, it is not the details but the individuality that connects us all. **The ability to reason about the world and our agency to mold it.** Inspiration from others abounds but it also quickly fades. Sort of a fire starter that you can summon on command but its up to you to throw in the logs to keep it alight.

Here are a few extracts from an [Interview at Oxford Union (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-xCIstDBaI) that resonate.

**On beginnings**. I came from a very working class world. 
But a working class world that had self-esteem and pride, they knew their position. 
The front gardens were always tendered. The back garden is where you grew your vegetables and you dried your washing.

**On Simplicity**. It's very easy to overwork and overthink something. 
The secret is to have confidence in what you do.
Why take something and make it something it's not?

**On honesty**. I always believed in one thing when I was in the kitchen. Honesty with yourself. Is it within me to win 2 starts in michelin? Do I have what it takes? And I said to myself, "yes". So I started pushing and pushing and pushing, because it's about self belief, at whatever cost. 

**On dreams**. It is not you but other people that make your dreams come true.
At the end you are just a pied piper, if they're not prepared to follow you 6 days a week 18 hours a day, it will not come true.

**On greatness**.
If someone asks me, what makes a great chef? I'd say three things:
1. They accept and respect that mother nature is the true artist and they are the cook.
2. Everything they do becomes an extension of them as a person.
3. They give insight into the world they were born into. The world that inspire them and they serve it on their plates.
