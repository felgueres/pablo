Reading should be taken seriously, both the act and the long-term planning of it. 
Aimless, passive reading is just another form of entertainment and procrastination.

I'm set out to build a curriculum and here's what I'm looking to get out from it:
- Understand the spirit of the West and what made it successful
- Get simple, truth-seeking principles to use systematically when understanding new problems 
- Learn the great myths and stories from which new ones are continuosly derived 
- Refine my reasoning ability
- Discover otherwise difficult to find ideas 

Here's how I'll get there (wip)
