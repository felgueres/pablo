One of the great American myths is the frontier line. 
A place between civilization and wilderness where ingenuity and self-reliance emerge to win over nature.

Frontier men yearn discovery and progress, and by leaving the established world behind, they reinvent the institutions that no longer serve their new course.

There is no physical boundary left like the Wild West once was, but the story simmers in the minds of pioneers at the call of something new to bet their lives on.
