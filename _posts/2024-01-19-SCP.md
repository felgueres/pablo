If you live in a dense area of San Francisco, you can't consistently park on the same street. Every street has its own cleaning schedule so very quickly you start spending cycles to track and move your car before you get hit with a 90 USD ticket. 

The problem seems too ordinary at first but my gf and I racked up 7 last year, and there were 500K in 2023 overall -- 45M/yr starts to look not so trivial of a cost, some automation and should help.

Using the [street line segments and schedule pairs](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Sweeping-Schedule/yhqp-riqs/about_data):

1. Calculate the bearing angle for each street line which is the orientation considering Earthâ€™s shape. 

2. Offset it orthogonally to distinguish block sides (N,S,E,W).

3. Use GPS ping to search line segments and block sides. Brute forcing this was super slow ~700ms so I divided the city into a grid to check for membership, bringing it to <5ms.
