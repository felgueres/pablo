Artists show clear aesthetic demarcation between periods, they want to be distanced from previous movement -- the romanists want to be distanced from barrocans, modernism from realism, and so on.

This alternation has a mark on multiple axes: historical periods, institutions, and broadly thought. In particular, we seem to favor function vs. beauty.

Take architecture, the renaissance favored reason and the functional, while the successor, the barrocan seeked to express new forms.

In economics, during the Gilded Age, we favored romantic ideas, the ethereal and new expression. As the great depression followed, we went back to valuing industriousness and frugality, both in economics and thought. 

If these cycles are bound by economics and new technology, and given technology is accelerating, will we asymptote onto a single representation of beauty and culture?
