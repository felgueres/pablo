Artists are a good indicators of alternating periods. They demarcate the ideas in their work in order to be distanced from a previous movement -- the romanists wanted to be distanced from barrocans, modernism from realism, and so on.

A feature that seems to repeat over time is to alternate between function and beauty. Take architecture, the renaissance favored reason and the functional while the barrocan searched for new ideas of expression, without much concern for utility.

Something similar happens with the economy. During the gilded age -- a period of abundance -- society favored romantism and the ethereal. Later, as the great depression unfolded, society went back to valuing industriousness and frugality.

I'm thinking that if these cycles are bound by the state of the economy and accelerated by technology, perhaps culture will asymptote towards an average flavor of culture.
