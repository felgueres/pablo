There are alternating periods where we favor the functional, other times we favor beauty.  

In architechture, there's alternation between functional spaces, and expressing new forms -- renaissance vs. barrocan.

The renaissance favored reason while the next period favored romanticism. 

Again during the Gilded Age, culture favored romantic ideas, the ethereal. 
In the great depression, we went back to valuing industriousness and frugality, in economics and thought. 

The artists in these periods show clear demarcation. 
The romanists want to be distanced from barrocans.

If these cycles are bound by economics and new technology, and given technology is accelerating, will we asymptote onto a single representation of beauty and culture?
