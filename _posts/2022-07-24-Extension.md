Marco Pierre White has been a continuous source of inspiration. 

His story is about self-belief, about drawing inspiration from your beginnings, and, the push to attain your dreams at whatever cost. The refusal to conform later led him to walk away from status and great financial upside.

It is the uncompromised individual that fuels me -- people that do great things not for prestige and even in spite of it.

Here are a few extracts from an [Interview at Oxford Union (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-xCIstDBaI).

------ 

&nbsp;  

**On beginnings**. I came from a very working class world. 
But a working class world that had self-esteem and pride, they knew their position. 
The front gardens were always tendered. The back garden is were you grew your vegetables and you dried your washing.

**On Simplicity**. It's very easy to overwork and overthink something. 
The secret is to have confidence in what you do.
Why take something and make it something it's not?

**On honesty with yourself**. I always believed in one thing when I was in the kitchen. Honesty with yourself. Is it within me to win 2 starts in michelin? Do I have what it takes? And I said to myself, "yes". So I started pushing and pushing and pushing, because it's about self belief, at whatever cost. 

**On dreams**. It is not you but other people that make your dreams come true.
At the end you are just a pied piper, if they're not prepared to follow you 6 days a week 18 hours a day, it will not come true.

**On greatness**.
If someone asks me, what makes a great chef? I'd say three things:
1. They accept and respect that mother nature is the true artist and they are the cook.
2. Everything they do becomes an extension of themselves as a person.
3. They give insight into the world they were born into. The world that inspire them and they serve it on their plates.
