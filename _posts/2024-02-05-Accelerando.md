Recently read [Accelerando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando), a scifi novel about the singularity. One idea that seems imminent as AI becomes more powerful and we loose the ability to discern between human-made and AI-made:

As the world saturates with credible information generated by AI, reputation becomes the scarce resource. The impact you bring to your community becomes proportional to your access to resources. It becomes the form of currency to barter for goods, services, and the influence you wield.
