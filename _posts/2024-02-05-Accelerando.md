[Accelerando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando) is the first scifi I read where the characters don't talk giberish. I loved that the there is enough detail to trace a path from our current tech tree to an extrapolated one, even as it deals with an exponential. 

One theme worth pondering:

As the world saturates with credible information generated by AI, reputation becomes the scarce resource. The impact you bring to your community becomes proportional to your access to resources. It becomes the form of currency to barter for goods, services, and the influence you wield.
