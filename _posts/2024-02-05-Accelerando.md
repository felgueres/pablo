[Accelerando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando) is the first scifi I read where the characters don't talk in english giberish. I loved that the there is enough detail to trace a path from our current tech tree to an extrapolated one, even as it deals with an exponential. 

I noticed two themes worth pondering:

As the world saturates with credible information generated by AI, reputation becomes the scarce resource. The impact you bring to your community becomes proportional to your access to resources. It becomes the form of currency to barter for goods, services, and the influence you can wield.

As you embed greater intelligence into the human body, the rate limiter and first thing to go is our human body. Consciousness is bound to reign and the human form quickly fades away.
