Recently read [Accelerando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando), a scifi around the singularity. It definitely requires suspended disbelief to follow the story, particularly from the second part onwards, but overall I loved the attention to technical detail. 

One idea that seems immininent as AI becomes more powerful and we loose the ability to discern between human-made and AI-made:

As the world saturates with credible information generated by AI, reputation becomes the scarce resource. The impact you bring to your community becomes proportional to your access to resources. It becomes the form of currency to barter for goods, services, and the influence you wield.
