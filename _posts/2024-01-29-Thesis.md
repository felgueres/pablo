Here's a short thesis on using AI agents to put rental property on autopilot.  
Inspired by Autonomous Economic Entities from the book [Accelerando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando).

Owning rental property implies keeping up with laws, market trends, screening & placing tenants, online listings, and day to day task coordination. Half of all rental properties in the US are under management by companies that make this easy for individuals or commercial clients. They charge 8-15% of rental revenue which adds up to a ~100B ARR industry.

I believe a system of AI tools in orchestration can automate and improve the experience for tenants and owners. The management process is mostly a set of text-based transactional tasks and some in person coordination. Adding foundation models to these workflows would drop the cost of management and improve property investments for customers.

For example, for day to day operations, an assistant that can interact with tenants and coordinate multiplayer solutions is worth exploring. On the demand front, from crawling listings you get pricing information, customer trends, and other visual data to improve vacancy rates, marketing materials, and discover optimal renting prices.
