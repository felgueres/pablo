Technology is the result of social and political choices. An extreme example is [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), which is not a law, but a social contract of monumental proportions that continues to deliver 50 years on. 

Examining the narratives floating around can give us insight into where we are heading. In this post I have started to compile the ones that are most salient to me.

## **Rethinking defense systems**
The US is ahead of its adversaries when it comes to exquisite platforms like aircraft carriers and F-35s. But bumping heads is not China's strategy, it is to develop asymmetric advantages. 

As China ramps up their defense spending, a key element of their arsenal is low cost, distributed and autonomous systems. Sillicon Valley is tapping into their defense roots and figuring out ways to diffuse consumer technology into defense. 

The rate limiters of progress seem to be IP regulation, available 'patient' capital, and the security hurdles to work with the DoD.

## **Restructuring supply chains**
More than 94% of Fortune 500 companies have some for of investment in Chinese supply chains. In the last 50 years, US firms followed the outsourcing model of move manufacturing overseas to improve margins. 

The unseen effect is a brittle supply chain prone to disruptions. Restoring the industrial base is imperative for national interest. 

The challenge is to rebuild the industrial base with a limited labor force and globalized  competition. Robotics, retraining and upskilling, immigration policy, and automation are the obvious levers.

## **Serious entrepreneurs against the malaise**
The prevailing low trust of government institutions puts into question their ability to advance the base infrastructure of the US. It starts with bad incentives as legislator compensation is not tied to the outcomes of their policies. 

Although venture capital is not traditionally a patience model, the startups that tackle this problems have a chance to take on larger shares of GDP, which will justify the longer lead times of investment.

## **Three pillars of sustainable energy**
The transition to sustainable energy depends on deploying supply, demand and matching technologies -- the matching piece is storage. 

The rate limiter to how fast we can go hinges on battery cell production. Drilling further, the crux is on the availability and price of raw materials. 

The key minerals -- Nickel and Lithium -- are ubiqutuous, but the US does not currently have commerical mining and refining operations for them. China has been on a 30-year campaign to secure mining and processing technologies to be a provider of the world.

## **Highway to space**
Space has been historically a low volume, low demand industry given the high CAPEX to move things into orbit. Reusable rockets are dramaticly improving the tonnage to orbit cost, sort of an equivalent to opening a space highway. 

Reliable and low cost access to space is critical for national security, connectivity, and deep space research. But there is also the hopes of building an entirely new supply chain the exploit the properties of low gravity.
