Technology is the result of social and political choices. An extreme example is [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), which is not a law, but a social contract of monumental proportions that continues to deliver 50 years on. 

Examining the narratives floating around can give us insight into where we are heading. In this post I have started to compile the ones that are most salient to me.

## **Rethinking defense systems**
In the future of warfare, spending is becoming less correlated with superiority as new asymmetric technologies come online. 

Exquisite platforms like aircraft carriers and F-35s will become less effective as lower cost, distributed, and autonomous systems come online. 
The socialist market economy of China has the structural advantage of being able to diffuse talent and technology from the consumer space -- often leaders in this type of systems -- into their defense needs. 

In the US, the DoD supplier base is pinned by a cost-plus constract incentives that promotes long lead times and high costs of innovation. So an overhaul can't happen soon enough, Sillicon Valley needs to tap into their defense roots to bridge this gap.

The rate limiters of progress seem to be IP regulation, available 'patient' capital, and the hurdles to work with the DoD.

## **Restructuring supply chains**
In the last 50 years, US firms followed the outsourcing model of move manufacturing overseas to improve margins. More than 94% of Fortune 500 companies have some for of investment in Chinese supply chains. The unseen effect is a brittle supply chain accruing risk over time. Like being an old person with a young man insurance -- sure the premium is low but wait to see the deductible. 

Restoring the industrial base is imperative for national interest. It prevents way of living from being disrupted. The challenge is to rebuild it with limited labor force and globalized competition.

Robotics, retraining and upskilling, immigration policy, and automation the obvious levers.

## **Serious entrepreneurs against the malaise**
Legislators' compensation is not tied to the outcomes of their policies. This is a strong predictor of their ability to advance the underlying infrastructure of the economy. The hope is to increase the Government's efficacy by injecting free markets to it.

Although venture capital is not traditionally a patience model, the bold startups attempting to solve these problems have a chance to take on larger shares of GDP and justifying the longer lead times of investment.

## **Three pillars of sustainable energy**
The transition to sustainable energy depends on deploying supply, demand and matching technologies -- the matching piece is storage. 

The rate limiter to how fast we can go are the raw materials for battery cell production. And although the minerals -- Nickel and Lithium -- are ubiqutuous, the US does not have commerical mining and refining operations for them. 

China on the other has been on a 30-year world campaign to secure mining and processing technologies.

## **Highway to space**
Space has been historically a low volume, low demand industry given the high CAPEX to move things into orbit. Reusable rockets are dramaticly improving the tonnage to orbit cost, sort of an equivalent to opening a space highway. 

Reliable and low cost access to space is critical for national security, connectivity, and deep space research. But there is also the hopes of building an entirely new supply chain the exploit the properties of low gravity.
