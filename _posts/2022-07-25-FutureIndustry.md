Technology is the result of social and political choices. An extreme example is [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), which is not a law, but a social contract of monumental proportions that continues to deliver 50 years on. 

Examining the narratives floating around can give us insight into where we are heading. In this post I have started to compile the ones that are most salient to me.

## **Rethinking defense systems**
The US is ahead of its adversaries when it comes to exquisite platforms like aircraft carriers and F-35s. But bumping heads is not China's strategy, it is rather to develop asymmetric advantages in the long term. Take them at their [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_Warfare#Defense_against_unrestricted_warfare). 

As China ramps up their defense spending (800% increase since 1990), a key element of their arsenal is lower cost, distributed and autonomous systems. The CCP advantage is the ability to muster talent and technology from any firm and diffuse it into their defense needs.

But the DoD and its heavilty consolidated supplier base does not excel at this new capabilities and the voices are coming from inside the house. A competitive market for talent, cultural and cost-plus contracts are structural barriers that limit the rate of innovation. 

Sillicon Valley is tapping into their deep defense roots. 
The innovation rate limiters into seems to be IP regulation, patient capital, and the slow process of rebuilding a manufacturing stock.

## **Restructuring supply chains**
In the last 50 years, US firms followed the outsourcing model. Move supply chains to China to improve margins and reinvest profits in engineering and design to develop new products. More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies have some for of investment in Chinese supply chains[^1-**addsource**]. 

The unseen effect of leaning supply chains is the increased risk to disruptions.

Inadequate labor supply and higher regulation relative to China are the main contributors to higher cost. Other primary inputs like industrial energy, both electrical and heat, are roughly on par between US and China. 
   
New immigration, retraining workforce, near-shoring to Mexico, tighter supply cooperation, robotics, and, automation is the narrative pushing us forward.

## **Serious entrepreneurs against the malaise**
There is the prevailing belief that the west is destined for decline. With the trust in institutions is at an all-time low and strong signals of stagflation, we must muster our strongest tool: free markets. 

The realm of government has an incentives and talent problem. Legislators compensation is not tighed to outcomes and their ability to attract talent is hindered by low salaries and the perceived bureucratic culture. 

Although the model of venture capital has not been one of patience, the infrastructure level innovations to push us forward represent bigger shares of GDP after all.

## **Three pillars of sustainable energy**
The transition to sustainable energy depends on deploying supply, demand and matching technologies -- the matching piece is storage. 

The rate limiter to how fast we can go hinges on battery cell production. When you drill further down the battery cost structure, the materials to produce the cathode are the crux of the problem. 

Although the key minerals -- Nickel and Lithium -- are ubiqutuous, the US does not currently have commerical mining and refining operations for them. China has been on a 30-year campaign to secure controlling stakes worldwide and develop the refining technologies to be a provider of the world. In hindsight, China ate our lunch, but the batteries production are our wedge to get back on the metals saddle.

## **Highway to space**
Space has been historically a low volume, low demand industry given the high CAPEX to move things into orbit. Reusable rockets are dramaticly improving the tonnage to orbit cost, sort of an equivalent to opening a space highway. 

Reliable and low cost access to space is critical for national security, connectivity, and deep space research. But there is also the hopes of building an entirely new supply chain the exploit the properties of low gravity.
