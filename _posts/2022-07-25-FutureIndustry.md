The transition to sustainable energy is unequivocally one of civilization's acid tests.

The dominant narrative for sustainable energy is to curb climate change. The other much obvious one is that fossil fuels will run out within the century [^basecase], and, the world's economy depends on them as primary energy source (84% in 2020[^0]). 

In our ability to extend this conclusion, it hinges the

accelFrom the correlation between energy usage and quality of life, it is easy to extend the conclusion that in our ability to accelerate this transition, hinges our ability to . 

I worked in industrial solar a few years back, so this deep dive is both a personal effort to understand the gap from when I left and to break down the constituents of the rate of deployment.

Let's take a look at the US and China's sustainable energy supply chain from a systems perspective. 

What are the rate limiters for the US transition? How are these systems structured? 

These are the questions I'm trying to understand. 

Dividing the system into 3 components: 

1. Inputs: Materials, Labor, Energy, Capital & Funding
2. Production: Manufacturing Capacity
3. Outputs: Market Dynamics

# **Inputs**
#### Materials 
- US had domestic supply chain of rare-earth metals. China flooded markets in late 90s (see Mountain Pass history).
- US has access to most raw materials but does low mining and no refinement (see reference).
- China has been on a 30-yr campaign to secure controlling stakes in mines and building inland processing capacity. Currenly > 60% of the world's mining and processing (see NREL)
- Processing technology is high-resource intensive with potential to be rethought (eg. Tesla's Battery day).

#### Labor
- Poor career prospects in mining has decreased academic research and workforce (see Society of Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration)

#### Energy

Electricity Industrial Prices 

| $ / MWh    |
| US | China |

#### Capital & Funding Strategies
1. America leads in basic research and applied research, in part due to historical bipartisan support via grants 

# **Production** 
#### Manufacturing Capacity
2. China has clever ways to bypass WTO rules. Combination of grants, market discipline and structural incentives.
4. 50 years of offshoring has following operational consequences in the manufacturing stock: 
   - Eroded ability to implement and upscale innovations decreasing self-reliance.
   - US has an inadequate labor force -- in size and training.
7. There are strategic areas for self-reliance and national security: 
   - Chips, AI 

# **Outputs**
#### Market Dynamics

[^basecase]: The most simple base case for oil depletion is as follows:  
     - The US proved oil reserves are 1,244 million barrels [^1].
     - Suppose the current rate of ~20 million barrels[^2].
     - That's a 60 year runway. Natural gas and coal have similar scenarios with depletion ranges between 70-100 years.
