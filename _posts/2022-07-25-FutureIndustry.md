Technology is the result of social and political choices. An extreme example is [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), which is not a law, but a social contract of monumental proportions that continues to deliver 50 years on. 

Examining the narratives floating around can give us insight into where we are heading. In this post I have started to compile the ones that are most salient to me.

## **Rethinking defense systems**
The US is ahead of its adversaries when it comes to exquisite platforms like aircraft carriers and F-35s. But bumping heads is not China's strategy, it is to develop asymmetric advantages. 

As China ramps up their defense spending (800% increase since 1990), a key element of their arsenal is lower cost, distributed and autonomous systems. In the west, Sillicon Valley is tapping into their deep defense roots. The rate limiters of progress seem to be IP regulation, available 'patient' capital, and hurdles of compliance for new entrants.

## **Restructuring supply chains**
More than 94% of Fortune 500 companies have some for of investment in Chinese supply chains. In the last 50 years, US firms followed the outsourcing model; move supply chains overseas to improve margins and reinvest in developing new products. The unseen effect of leaning supply chains is the increased risk to disruptions.

Restoring the industrial base is imperative for national interest. The challenge is to rebuild in the context of limited labor force. Robotics, immigration, near-shoring and automation are the main arrows.

## **Serious entrepreneurs against the malaise**
There is the prevailing low trust of government institutions to innovate infrastructure, the belief is that we should muster free markets. It starts with incentives, legislators compensation is not tighed to outcomes and their ability to attract talent is hindered by low salaries and the perceived bureucratic culture. 

Although venture capital is not traditionally a model patient capital, the projects that could be tackled by this new archteype of startups have a chance to take on larger shares of GDP.

## **Three pillars of sustainable energy**
The transition to sustainable energy depends on deploying supply, demand and matching technologies -- the matching piece is storage. 

The rate limiter to how fast we can go hinges on battery cell production. Drilling further, the crux is on the availability and price of raw materials. 

The key minerals -- Nickel and Lithium -- are ubiqutuous, but the US does not currently have commerical mining and refining operations for them. China has been on a 30-year campaign to secure mining and processing technologies to be a provider of the world.

## **Highway to space**
Space has been historically a low volume, low demand industry given the high CAPEX to move things into orbit. Reusable rockets are dramaticly improving the tonnage to orbit cost, sort of an equivalent to opening a space highway. 

Reliable and low cost access to space is critical for national security, connectivity, and deep space research. But there is also the hopes of building an entirely new supply chain the exploit the properties of low gravity.
