This is a summary of the themes I'm able to pick up in my world.

If technology is advanced by social and political choices, these are the narratives that seem most salient right now.

1. The US ability to manufacture competitively has been eroded by 50 years of offshoring. What started as outsourcing exclusively manufacturing has now evolved into mfg, eng and design of new products by these firms. 

   Looking into the inflows for production: materials, labor, energy and capital, the belief is that inadequate labor supply and higher regulation costs relative to China are the primary sources of delta.  

   **Solution space:** immigration policies, near-shoring, robotics, and, automation. 
   Some belive in the Nile of the West -- a new corridor guided by the Mississipi basin and including the Heartland states, Texas, Florida, and parts of industrialized northern Mexico.

2. Another interpetation of this is that the US moved into an intangibles economy. The growth stagnation is explained by either lack of competition between these new firms or the wrong financial institutions to support them. 

3. US is reevaluating its self-reliance to China on strategic manufacturing sectors. Mainly in defense, semiconductors and chips, and the mining and refining of critical technology metals. 

4. The US government is unable to carry infrastructure modernization of the country. A key driver is the low access of top talent given market competition, primarily from Tech. VCs believe there is a 

5. Software-only is saturated. A16Z is dedicating rougly 1/3 of their resources to Web3, the rest between SaaS and cautiously into a wave of new physical + software products that promise capturing greater basis points of GDP.

6. The DoD has realized that platforms are not the future of war but rather, distributed, lower cost, autonomous systems. The consolidated supplier base of 5 primes (an order of magnitude less than in 1990s) does not excel at these technologies nor have the correct incentive structure to build with urgency and competitively. 

7. Raw materials for advanced manufacturing, specially battery metals required for the sustainable energy transition is dominated by China. Mining is geographically concentrated in a few countries in South America, Africa and Australia although secured by Chinese interests through majority stakes. The processing technologies to yield battery grade materials is >60% controlled by China as well. Although there is significant research into new chemistries, at the moment, the primary rate limiter of scaling EVs is battery cell production, therefore, it is beholden to China.
