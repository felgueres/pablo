Technology is the result of social and political choices. An extreme example is [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), which is not a law, but a social contract of monumental undertaking that continues to deliver 50 years on. 

Examining the narratives we tell our selves can give us insight into where we are heading. In this post I have started to compile the ones that are most salient to me while living in San Francisco.

## **Rethinking defense systems**
The future of warfare is the combination of exquisite platforms and distributed, low cost, autonomous systems. 
As China ramps up their defense spending (800% increase since 1990) and looks for asymmetric advantages against the west, the US has to rethink their 

The DoD prime contractors lack the incentive structure to innovate fast enough and competitively to outpace China.
Their current talent pool and cost-plus contract structure. 

The way forward seems to be:
- Diffusion of consumer-based technology and talent into defense
- Innovative funding structures
- Revising IP rules

## **Restructuring supply chains**
In the last 50 years, US firms have outsourced their supply chains to China seeking to improve margins and reinvest profits in engineering and design to develop new products.

Framing the size of this operation is often not clear, >90% of Fortune 500 companies have some for of investment in Chinese supply chains; this amounts to trillions of dollars. 

The unseen effect of leaning supply chains is the increased risk to disruptions.

Inadequate labor supply and higher regulation relative to China are the main contributors to higher cost. Other primary inputs like industrial energy, both electrical and heat, are roughly on par between US and China. 
   
New immigration, retraining workforce, near-shoring to Mexico, tighter supply cooperation, robotics, and, automation

## **Seriousness as cure to the cultural malaise**
Government has an incentives and talent problem. Legislators compensation is not tighed to outcomes and their ability to attract talent is hindered by competitive salaries and the perception.

   **P**: Inability to modernize infrastructure, erosion of American values

## **Three pillars of sustainable energy**
One of the key rate limiters of the sustainable energy transition is scaling energy storage for both stationary and non-stationary applications.

Mining is geographically concentrated in a few countries in South America, Africa and Australia although secured by Chinese interests through majority stakes. The processing technologies to yield battery grade materials is >60% controlled by China as well. Although there is significant research into new chemistries, at the moment, the primary rate limiter of scaling EVs is battery cell production, therefore, it is beholden to China.

## **Highway to space**
Reusable rockets are unlocking a dramatic improvement in the cost of tonnage-to-orbit, sort of equivalent to space highways. Reliable and low cost access to space is critical for national security, connectivity, and deep space research. It also opens up the door to industrialize the
