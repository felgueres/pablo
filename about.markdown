I use writing to test my individuality. It helps to discover what I actually think. Typically I ask a question and assume that my highest conviction answer is something I heard. I then try to deduce the answer and in that process, it is the concomittant ideas that I find worth thinking about. 

But perhaps the important reason for writing is coming back to read my words. I get the simultaneous feeling of strangement, while reliving the precise moment of when I wrote them.
