I use writing to test my individuality. It helps to discover what I actually think. Typically I ask a question and assume that my highest conviction answer is something I heard. I then try to deduce the answer and in that process, it is the concomittant ideas I find worth thinking about. 

But perhaps the important reason is to come back to read my posts after some time.  
I get a simultaneous feeling of surprise while reliving the precise moment of when I wrote them.
