I like to write as an exercise of intellectual honesty.  
There is also the thrill that, in the process, I may discover an anomaly or something new.  
But what appeals me most is writing as an extension of memory. When I come back, I get a simultaneous feeling of surprise while reliving the precise moment of when I wrote these words.
